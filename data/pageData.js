A great design should complement the architecture of the home and provide harmony with nature, connecting the indoor and outdoor spaces. The well thought out design will create garden views from inside the home and include a carefully selected plant list specific for the project.',

Plant material has certain requirements in order to thrive. The physical limitations and requirements of a site always need to be understood and met. All things considered, Living Space Landscapes can creatively design your landscape to be a source of pleasure to you and your friends, not a burden or an anxiety.'

These specimen trees rely on craftsmanship, horticultural knowledge, and a sense of proportion and balance to maintain their shape.',

Other Minnesota landscape companies also commission us to provide the aesthetic pruning for their clients that have giant bonsai trees.'
